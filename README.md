## Running:
Write an .env file
```pdm install```
```pdm run bot```

## Goals:
1. Tries to be 99% compatible with GIR
2. New codebase
3. Speed
4. Multi-Threading

## Testing:
While in development stage, you do not need to do very extensive tests AND may do commits directly to `main`. Once the bot is released, only bug fixes should be directly pushed to `main`, otherwise to `development` (to be made once released)
